In respect to some useful feedback that you might find useful for this course, when I think of how a course should have it's material to learn laid out, I think of how a video game should be. In terms of maybe an introduction stage, things should be somewhat intuitive, and when there are challenges to accomplish, it should force you to learn a certain thing that would be fundamental to later stages of a game. One game that comes to my mind that fulfills those two requirements is Mega Man X for the SNES. It's quite subtle, but it systematically introduces concepts of the game that are necessary to learn in order to progress through and win the stage. First, it introduces enemies to you, which most people jump over cause it comes by very fast giving you little reaction time. The second enemy introduced is a larger, immobile enemy that you cannot jump over. Players are forced to shoot it down before progressing. Later on, after learning one or two more concepts, the player falls down a very big hole, and is stranded. The player is going to attempt to jump up the wall, and will almost undoubtedly learn that they can scale walls, which is crucial to the gameplay. In two minutes, the game forces to teach you fundamental concepts that will assist you in the future, all without the need for an annoying side character telling you to blatantly do something or having text come up on the screen in a slightly obtrusive and uncreative manner. Though it may not as easy to make assignments in this manner (especially for the later assignments that are extensions of everything learned), I did my best to try and incorporate some of that into my assignment. Also one thing to note of for my philosophy is that if someone skips and assignment or does it late, it might hinder them for future ones. So it's probably best to do one of two reincarnations of a lesson trying to teach X or Y as a sort of failsafe. But of course, you shouldn't necessarily have to plan for that/accomodate for those who aren't up to speed with everyone else

Now as for this course, I think that my assignment will be useful as an assignment #3 or so, and it will force the student to learn how to manipulate commands passed into the terminal, use functions, and make use of outputting to the terminal and to files. Outputting to terminal should probably be learned by now, and will be reinforced. Outputting to files might be new, so that will be a concept introduced for future use. Command line arguments will probably be new, and are definitely necessary to learn. As for points breakdown:


Proper function use         30%
Correct conversion          20%
Input parsing               25%
Output                      15%
Style                       10%
