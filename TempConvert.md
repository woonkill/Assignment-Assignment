Write a program in Python that will convert several different temperatures from Farenheit to Celcius, and print them to either the Terminal or a file. An integer above 0 will be passed through the terminal, and a menu will be brought up giving the user a choice between converting from Celcius to Farenheit or from Farenheit to Celcius. When picked, another menu will come up asking whether to print to the Terminal or to a file called "ConvertedTemperature." After that, the program will read as many numbers from standard input from the Terminal argument specified and convert them all to the specified target. Name the program TempConvert, so the usage may be something like "./TempConvert 10" and will ask for the conversion type, where to output, and then read 10 numbers from standard input. You can choose to print out results inbetween each input or output at the end. Remember, the formula for converting from Celcius to Farenheit is "Degrees C" * 9/5 + 32 = "Degrees F." Although you can assume only integers will be passed through the Terminal, outputs must be exact (doubles or floats)

For this assignment, you must use at least one function throughout your program and it must have a significant use.
